MyFPGA package

Place your FPGA bitstream files (for example: mydesign.bit or mydesign.bin) into the
`package/firmware/myfpga/files/` directory. When you run the OpenWrt build system and
enable this package (in `make menuconfig` -> Firmware -> myfpga), the files in
`/lib/firmware/` will include your bitstream.

Steps:

1. Copy bitstream to package files:
   mkdir -p package/firmware/myfpga/files
   cp /path/to/mydesign.bit package/firmware/myfpga/files/

2. Configure OpenWrt build:
   make menuconfig
   -> Firmware -> myfpga (select)

3. Build image (recommended to build the image or the package):
   make -j$(nproc) V=s

4. After build, the firmware files will be installed in the target rootfs under /lib/firmware.

You can also add post-install scripts if you need to copy to other locations or run commands at boot.
